.Sh NAME
.Nm gotsh
.Nd Game of Trees Shell
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm Fl c Sq Cm git-receive-pack Ar repository-path
.Nm Fl c Sq Cm git-upload-pack Ar repository-path
.Nm Fl c Sq Cm weblogin Oo Ar hostname Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the network-facing interface to
.Xr gotd 8 .
It implements the server-side part of the Git network protocol used by
.Xr git 1
and
.Xr got 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
is not an interactive shell.
.Nm
is intended to be configured as the login shell of Git repository
user accounts on servers running
.Xr gotd 8 .
If users require a different login shell,
.Nm
can be installed in the command search path under the names
.Cm git-receive-pack
and
.Cm git-upload-pack ,
or
.Xr gitwrapper 1
can be used to select the appropriate command to run automatically.
.Pp
The users can then interact with
.Xr gotd 8
over the network.
When users invoke commands such as
.Cm got send
and
.Cm got fetch
on client machines,
.Xr got 1
will connect to the server with
.Xr ssh 1 .
.Nm
will facilitate communication between
.Xr gotd 8
running on the server machine and the
.Xr got 1
or
.Xr git 1
program running on the client machine.
.Pp
Users running
.Nm
should not have access to Git repositories by means other than
accessing the unix socket of
.Xr gotd 8
via
.Nm .
.Pp
The
.Cm weblogin
command provides user authentication for
.Xr gotwebd 8 .
.Nm
will connect to
.Xr gotwebd 8
and obtain a login URL which allows browsing private repositories the user
has been granted read access to in
.Xr gotwebd.conf 5 .
If multiple servers are declared in
.Xr gotwebd.conf 5
the
.Ar hostname
parameter is required and indicates the desired virtual host to use in the URL.
If no
.Ar hostname
is specified and only one server is declared in
.Xr gotwebd.conf 5
then the name of this server will be used in the URL.
.Pp
It is recommended to restrict
.Xr ssh 1
features available to users of
.Nm .
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for details.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width GOTD_UNIX_SOCKET
.It Ev GOTD_UNIX_SOCKET
Set the path to the unix socket which
.Xr gotd 8
is listening on.
If not specified, the default path
.Pa /var/run/gotd.sock
will be used.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Xr sshd_config 5
directives such as the following are recommended to protect the server
machine and any systems reachable from it, especially if anonymous users
are allowed to connect:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Match User developer
    DisableForwarding yes
    PermitTTY no
.Ed
.Pp
It can be convenient to add all relevant users to a common group, such as
.Dq developers ,
and then use this group as the Match criteria:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Match Group developers
    DisableForwarding yes
    PermitTTY no
.Ed
.Pp
Anonymous users can be given public read-only access by using a
.Xr gotd.conf 5
access rule such as the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
repository "public" {
	path "/var/git/public.git"
	permit ro anonymous
}
.Ed
.Pp
The anonymous user account should have a publicly known password, or can be
set up with an empty password in which case the user's
.Xr vipw 8
entry would look similar to this example:
.Bd -literal
anonymous::1002:1002::0:0:Anonymous:/home/anonymous:/usr/local/bin/gotsh
.Ed
.Pp
Use of an empty password must be explicitly allowed in
.Xr sshd_config 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Match User anonymous
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    PermitEmptyPasswords yes
    DisableForwarding yes
    PermitTTY no
.Ed
.Pp
Obtain a
.Xr gotwebd 8
login URL for got.example.com:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ssh got.example.com weblogin
.Ed
.Pp
If the web server at got.example.com serves virtual hosts then two
hostnames must be provided.
One for
.Xr ssh 1
to connect to, and another to identify the virtual host served by
.Xr gotwebd 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ssh got.example.com weblogin got.example.com
.Ed
.Pp
In practice both hostnames will often be the same, but this is not guaranteed.
There is no reliable way determine the desired virtual host automatically.
An
.Xr ssh_config 5
entry like the following can save some typing:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Host weblogin
	Hostname got.example.com
	RemoteCommand weblogin %h
.Ed
.Pp
The following command is now equivalent to the above:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ssh weblogin
.Ed
.Ed
